## Hi there 👋

I’m a Data Science graduate student at Texas A&M University with 3+ years of professional experience across data engineering, analytics, and applied AI. My work spans the full data lifecycle — from building scalable ETL and cloud data pipelines to developing AI-driven automation and intelligent agent systems.

Currently, I’m an AI Engineer Intern at TechSur Solutions, where I focus on designing multi-agent systems and automation workflows using modern frameworks like CrewAI, LangGraph, and PyTorch. Previously, I worked as a Data Engineer at Draup and Data Scientist at HighRadius, delivering end-to-end data solutions that enhanced performance, efficiency, and insight generation.

I’m passionate about bridging data infrastructure with AI innovation to create systems that are not just intelligent, but also scalable, explainable, and business-impact driven.
